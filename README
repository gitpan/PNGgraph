This is PNGgraph 1.11, a package to generate PNGG charts, using Lincoln
Stein's GD.pm.

INSTALLATION

needed to install

	perl 5.004
	GD >= 1.21

to install:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

to see some samples:

	cd samples
	make

That should generate a set of PNGs, which you can view using the HTML
pages in the same directory (or whichever other way pleases you).

One more sample is cgi_sample/pie.pl: copy it in your CGI directory and
send some HTTP requests like http://www.mysite.dom/pie.pl?x=5&y=19&z=3.

The documentation available is contained in PNGgraph.pm, as pod.

The latest release should normally be available from CPAN.

TESTED PLATFORMS (also see NOTES FOR WIN32)

- perl 5.005_03 on Red Hat Linux 5.2, GD 1.21
